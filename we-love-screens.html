<p>Anybody who knows me, knows that I’m a big believer in multiple screens. I started with two back in 2000,<br />
and have been stretching the boundaries ever since.<br />
I now own my own company, and it’s interesting to see how my team have not only adopted the habit, but<br />
are outperforming me with their screen count.</p>
<p>People who have visited our office can’t help but ask what they’re good for, and how we use all those screens<br />
(yes, many screens, one desk), this post was written to answer those questions.</p>
<h3 id="online-meeting-room">Online Meeting Room</h3>
<p>At Firefly Migrations we have many online meetings – so the room, or rather the screens are our windows to the<br />
world. We have recently upgraded our Online Meeting Room, and although there is still work to be done, here’s<br />
what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="photo-1_thumb3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are three 29 Inch Samsung screens, configured as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The left screen is shared between all meeting participants – we use it to show them their application in .NET</li>
<li>The middle screen shows the camera feed – so we can see who we are talking to. (I believe that seeing the<br />
person you’re communicating with helps to bridge the cyber gap).</li>
<li>The right screen is used for note taking and additional information we may need during the meeting.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rons-desk">Ron’s Desk</h3>
<p><img src="photo-3_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Ron is in charge of reproducing customer reports, and providing customers with online training. He has three 19 inch<br />
screens, used to run the original application, the migrated application and a screen to compare the two. He also has<br />
a 27 Inch wide screen, which he uses for online meetings.</p>
<h3 id="sefis-desk">Sefi’s Desk</h3>
<p><img src="photo-2_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sefi manages the migration projects, designs customer training and oversees them. He claims he needs more screens in<br />
order to stay on top of more things – we’ve accepted his claim 🙂.</p>
<p>Sefi has configured his screens like so:<br />
He uses two screens for .NET code, two screens for the tasks he’s working on, another for the file explorer, and one<br />
for the browser – that makes six.</p>
<h3 id="my-desk-noam">My Desk (Noam)</h3>
<p><img src="photo-4_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll find on my desk:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the left is my MacBook Pro, with an additional 29 inch attached.</li>
<li>My main machine has 6 screens, at the moment (64 bit, 32GB ram, i7):
<ul>
<li>On the right I have my task list.</li>
<li>The two big ones in the middle have .NET code on them, one for the migration engine and another for a<br />
customer’s code.</li>
<li>On the left is the customer’s magic code.</li>
<li>Top left shows the running application.</li>
<li>Top right shows the tests that have just run. (you will notice one has failed (in Red).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
