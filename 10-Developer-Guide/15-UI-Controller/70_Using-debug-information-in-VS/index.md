# Using the Debug information in visual studio 
In this page we'll:
* Use <kbd>Shift + F12</kbd> key combination, to debug the current running code.
* Use the "Watch window" to explore the information about the current controller.
* See the value in the "Watch Window" for the following items for example:
  * `AllowUpdate` - to see if we can update in this controller
  * `From` - to see the main table of this controller
  * `Where` - to see the current controller
  * `OrderBy` - the sort of the current controller
  * `Relations` - to see the different relations and their info
  * `Columns` - to see the columns in this controller

* Explain how to uncheck the "Show External Code" menu item, to only see relevant information while we debug and avoid the "Symbol file not loaded" message in visual studio
