# Display last line from a multiline column using Print preview

---

When using print preview the last line of a multiline column is not displayed.

By default, preview images for zoom filters in the 70%-130% range are created differently (using raster graphics instead of vector graphics) as some fonts don't scale well in that range. 
The other side of that is that there may be some clipped text with other fonts.

It's very simple to disable this mechanism by adding this code line to your Program.cs file:

```csdiff
ENV.Printing.PrinterWriter.PrintPreviewMaxRasterZoomFactor = 0;
```
