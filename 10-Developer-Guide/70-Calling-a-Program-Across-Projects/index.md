When large application are migrated, they are usually splitted into multiple siebling projects.

So far, when we have called a controller, it was eight in our project, or in a project we referenced, and we've done that using the `new` syntax.
```csdiff
new ShowOrders().Run();
```

When we are in a project, and we want to call a `controller` in a siebling project we need to use a different syntax.

For example - if we're in the `Northwind.Orders` project and we need the `ShowCustomers` program from the `Northwind.Customers` porject  to select a customer, we can't use the `new` syntax - since we are not referncing the `Northwind.Costomers` project. Instead we'll use a syntax called `Create`
```csdiff
Create<Northwind.Customers.IShowCustomers>().Run();
```

## Demo
1. In the `Northwind.Orders` project add a dev demo folder.
2. Add a UIContorller called `AddOrder`
3. Add a local TextColumn called CustomerId
4. Put it on the screen.
5. In the `OnStart` call the `ShowCustomers` controller to select a customer.


## Note

You can only call programs across project that were prepared for that.

The easy way to call a program in another project, is to add a reference to it. 

For example We can add in `Northwind.Orders` a reference to `Northwind.Customers` and it'll be ok.

The  problems starts if then we want to call a controller from `Northind.Customers`  to `Northwind.Orders` it'll create a cyrcular reference and break.

We do recommend adding the reference in most scenariosFor the rest learn how to adjust a program to be called across project see. [creating-a-program-that-can-be-called-across-projects.html](creating-a-program-that-can-be-called-across-projects.html)
