In Magic you could also have GUI models, which are migrated as a user controls and could be found  
in the Views/Controls folder in the *Base* project:

If you want to use them in your view you need to:
1. Open the view designer screen
2. In the toolbox right click on any tab and choose *Add Tab*
3. Provide it with a meaningful name, e.g. *MyControls*, and select it
4. On the view right click and choose *Add controls to toolbox*
5. Select your *Base* dll from your bin directory
6. In the opened screen expand the node with your controls, for example *Northwind.Views.Controls*
