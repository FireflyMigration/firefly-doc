In this article we'll:
* Explain how expressions in magic were migrated to methods that use the C#6 syntax
```csdiff
Bool Exp_9() => v_Total > 1000 && v_TotalInTheLastWarning != v_Total;
```
* Explain how we can use the "Rename Refactoring" in visual studio to change the name of migrated expressions from 'Exp_9' to a more meaningful name_
