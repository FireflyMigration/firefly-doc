The *Zoom* indication is usually in the status bar. It might be missed by users.  
This is why we have another indication, set using the ShowExapandButton control property:
![2018 03 07 15H39 36](2018-03-07_15h39_36.jpg)

Once it is set to *True*, a small arrow next to the control will indicate the *Expand* (Zoom) option:  
![2018 03 07 15H41 41](2018-03-07_15h41_41.jpg)
