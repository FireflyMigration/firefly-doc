# Task Name

Name in Migrated Code: **Title**   
Location in Migrated Code: **Constructor**  

![Task properties task-name](Task-properties-task-name.jpg)


## Example :
```csdiff
public ShowOrders()
{   
+    Title = "ShowOrders";  
}
```
## Notes:
The task name is migrated to a Class Name. In the migrated code, the original name is also preserved for backward compatibility reasons (Such as the Prog function) in the Title Property.
