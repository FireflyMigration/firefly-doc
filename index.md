# Firefly Documentation website

Welcome to Firefly's documentation web site.1

In this site you'll find useful information both for the migration project duration, and to your future as .NET developers.

For developers who are just now starting to develop in .NET and the migrated code we recommend that you'll start with our [developer guide](developer-guide.html)

If you want to contribute to this website, please follow the instructions at [how-to-edit-documents-on-firefly-doc](how-to-edit-documents-on-firefly-doc.html)
