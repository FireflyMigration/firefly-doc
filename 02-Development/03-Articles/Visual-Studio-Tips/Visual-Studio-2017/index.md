In this page we'll try to outline some of the things we like about Visual Studio 2017

### You can now filter the intelisense window
This is useful when you try to find a Column in an entity, and you only want to see "Fields"

### Improved search capabilities
Now you can search using <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> and search within a specific file, or for a specific type.
