In this tutorial we'll create a complex order & order detail form by exposing the appropriate server-side API and developing the front-end with Typescript and Angular.

This tutorial shows how you can develop a rich front-end for your web/mobile application with little effort, by covering common use cases, such as:

* Viewing master-detail data
* User filtering and sorting of millions of rows
* Updating and validating data
* Data lookups and select lists
* Web and Mobile compatibility

Let's get started.
