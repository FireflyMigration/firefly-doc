This is an optional step :)

Some times you want to share your dev site with someone to review, or maybe open it on your phone, or other computer.

The projects are already configured to support that using ngrok (www.ngrok.com).

Switch to VSCode, and in the terminal window type:
```
npm run ngrok
```

You'll see a URL that you then copy and paste to the browser.

You can share that URL or send it to your phone, and it'll open as well.

When you're done, close the terminal window using the Garbage can icon.

don't forget to deploy the work you do in the FrontEnd project to the MVC project to share the latest version.
