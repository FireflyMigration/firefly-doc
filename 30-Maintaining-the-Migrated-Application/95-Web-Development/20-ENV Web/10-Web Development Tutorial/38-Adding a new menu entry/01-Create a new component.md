# Create a new component

Using the terminal view, type:

```
npm run nc categories
```

If you want to specify more than one word as a component name, you need to use hyphen between the words and no upper case:

```
npm run nc categories-list
```

It will generate a new folder called "categories" with three files:

3)	categories.component.css -  The css for this specific component
