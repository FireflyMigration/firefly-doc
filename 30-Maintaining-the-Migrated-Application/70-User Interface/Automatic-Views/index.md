In this section we review how to use and create reusable views that are automatically generated and do not require any visual designing.

See [Using GridView and FormView to Create Automatic Views](10-Using-GridView-and-FormView-to-Create-Automatic-Views) for a ready made, out of the box solution you can use.

To understand how to create such reusable views see [Stop desinging forms
](stop-designing-forms.html) and [Creating reusable Views and Controllers](creating-reusable-views-and-controllers.html) for two separate reviews on how to create reusable automatic views.
