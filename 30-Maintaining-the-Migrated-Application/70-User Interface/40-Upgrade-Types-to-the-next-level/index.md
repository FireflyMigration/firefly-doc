# Busting Types to the next level

In the original code, the use of types was limited to :
1. Set the same format, cross the system. I.E. "First name" will be set to 30 chars everywhere in the system.  
2. Set a default program to be execute when the user hit the expend (Zoom) event.  
3. The ability to set the GUI display on a form. I.E. when I use ProductID on a form it will defaulting to combo box.

In the next set of articles you will understand how to achieve much more then just this options.
