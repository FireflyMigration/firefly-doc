# Taking "Types" to the next level

In the original code the use of Types was limited to:

1. Set the same column format across the system. (e.g. "First Name" will be 30 characters long everywhere in the system.)
2. Set a default program to be execute when the user invokes the "Expend" (a.k.a "Zoom") event.  
3. The ability to set the default visual Control used when the column is displayed on a form. (e.g. when I use "Product ID" on a form it will by default use a combo box.)

In the next set of articles you will understand how to achieve much more then just this options.
