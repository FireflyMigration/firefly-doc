# Enrich your WinForms app with the power of Html and Css

Often, as Winforms developers, we get a UI design done by a designer unfamiliar with the constraints of the Winforms technology, and we find ourselves unable to satisfy our bosses/customers.

Using the techniques in this video, we will be able to develop a beautiful user interface using HTML and CSS (and, even better, an external developer who enjoys that) and integrate it seamlessly into our application - freeing us to focus on the application's business rules.

In this video, we'll add a beautiful HTML-based dashboard to our migrated Northwind Winforms application that is embedded seamlessly into the Winforms application.
