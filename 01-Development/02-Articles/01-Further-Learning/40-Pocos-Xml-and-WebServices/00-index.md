In this section we explain how to read and write basic XML objects using POCO's

POCOs or **P**lain **O**ld **C**Sharp **O**bjects are basic classes that uses only basic C#.  
These classes are used to communicate between different programs and are easily translated to XML, JSON and any other form of communication.  
These POCO's are used in WebServices, Restful API's and all around the .NET World.

We'll review how to:
* Create simple POCOs
* Read and write them from XML
* Creating more complex POCOs
* Creating them based on database values, and updating the database according to their values

After that we'll:
* Polish and Generalize the Load and Save to XML Method


Later we show how to:
* Consume WebServices
* Receive data From a WebService, using POCOs
* Send data to a WebService, using POCOs
