# Database Connections basic terms and concepts

n this article and the next one  I am going to take you on a journey from the old and familiar to the new and exciting. By the end of this article, we are going to understand how to setup database connection and use it in our code.

First, we are going to start with the INI file, specifically in the [MAGIC_DATABASE] section:

```
[MAGIC_DATABASES]
Default Database = 1, , , , , , , , MagicRecordLock, ChangeFileInToolkit, +
CheckDefinition, CheckKey, FileLocks, , , , NoCheckExist, , ,
Btrieve = 22, Memory, , , , %ENVOYPATHS%, , , NoMagicRecordLock, ChangeFile+
InToolkit, CheckDefinition, CheckKey, NoFileLocks, , , NoCheckExist, +
NoCheckExist, 0, NoXATrans, NoXATrans, NoAS400SrvrSort,
Memory = 22, , , , , , , , NoMagicRecordLock, ChangeFileInToolkit, +
NoCheckDefinition, NoCheckKey, NoFileLocks, , , , NoCheckExist, , ,
Northwind = 21, Northwind, , , (local)\SQLExpress, , , , NoMagicRecordLock,+
 DontChangeFileInToolkit, CheckDefinition, NoCheckKey, NoFileLocks, , , , +
CheckExist, 0, , NoXATrans, NoAS400SrvrSort,
```
If we centralize our attention to the Northwind entry we can notice the following :

21 = SQL database (as specified in the DBMS section of the INI)  
Northwind = name of the database  
(local)\SQLExpress = name of the database server and so on. 

The next step is to read the INI file – the Firefly platform is using the ENV.DATA.DataProvider.ConnectionManager.cs class to do so.  
The “ConnectionManager” is responsible for opening and closing the connection with the database.

Now we can use this information in the Models.DataSources.cs file :

```csdiff
using ENV.Data.DataProvider;
namespace Northwind.Models
{
    public class DataSources
    {
        public static DynamicSQLSupportingDataProvider Northwind1 
        {
            get
            {
                return ConnectionManager.GetSQLDataProvider("Northwind");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We can see that the return value is “DynamicSQLSupporingDataProvider”, which means that this is a connection to an SQL database, rather than Memory, Btrieve, etc.

The property “getter” (get) asks the “ConnectionManager” class for a SQLDataProvider by the name of the entry in the INI file “Northwind”.

The next step is to use this as part of setting an entity in the application.
We need to setup the base connection of the entity :
