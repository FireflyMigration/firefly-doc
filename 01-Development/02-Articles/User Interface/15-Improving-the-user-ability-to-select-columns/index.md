# Improving the user ability to select columns

We have improved the ability for end users to select the columns they want to see and save that setting. We’ve also made sure that a column that was determined as not visible by the code itself – will remain so, and the user will not be able to add it.  
In this video we also show the changes we have done to the ENV code to support that, so that if you have an older version of ENV you can add that yourself.
