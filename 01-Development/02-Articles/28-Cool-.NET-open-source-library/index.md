# Cool .NET open source library

I have ran into the following article describing an open source library that makes readable text from datatypes.

It’s called Humanizer and it turns text from:  
NoamHonig => Noam Honig.

It also writes dates as a string, like:

14/4/14 => 4 days from now.

Here is the original article:
