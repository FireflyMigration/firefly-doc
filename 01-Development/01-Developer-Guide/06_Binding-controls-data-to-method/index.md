In this article We'll:
* Create a GetDayOfWeek method and bind a control to the result of this method.
* Explain the different parts of the method
* We need the method to be `internal` or `public` because we want to use it in another class - the `ShowOrdersView` class
* The method has to have the one of the migrated return types `Text`, `Number`, `Date`, `Time` or `Bool`
```csdiff
internal Text GetDayOfWeek()
{
    return Orders.OrderDate.DayOfWeek.ToString();
}
```

* Review the Property Sheet in the Visual Studio Designer
* Explain about the quick properties window
