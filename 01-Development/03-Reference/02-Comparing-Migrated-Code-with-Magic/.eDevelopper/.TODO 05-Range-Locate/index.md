# Introduction
This article is one of a series of articles aimed at providing further orientation with the migrated code for Magic programmers. This time we will look at the 'Range/Locate' screens as they appear in eDeveloper (version 9) and show the equivelant representation of each property in the migrated code. Many of the Magic properties have various options and we will also look at the different representations in the migrated code for each option.

There are two such tabs in eDeveloper, with the following tags: Properties, Advanced and Enhanced. Let's look at each Tab seperately.

## Range/Locate
