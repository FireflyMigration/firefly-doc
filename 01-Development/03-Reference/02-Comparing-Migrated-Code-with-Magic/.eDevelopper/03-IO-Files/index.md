# Comparison with eDeveloper's I/O Files Dialog Box

## Introduction
This article is one of a series of articles aimed at providing further orientation with the migrated code for Magic programmers. This time we will look at the 'I/O Files' screen as it appears in eDeveloper (version 9) and show the equivalent representation of each setting and property in the migrated code.

Let's look at the eDeveloper I/O Files screen, used for defining I/O for printing to a printer device or for reading and writing to a file:

The properties section looks like this:

The actual output or input device is determined in Magic by the Media property. The following table specifies the different Media defined in Magic and their .Net counterparts in the migrated code.

| No 	| Media Type                 	| Name in migrated code                       	|
|----	|----------------------------	|---------------------------------------------	|
| 1. 	| Graphic Printer            	| PrinterWriter                               	|
| 2. 	| Printer                    	| TextPrinterWriter                           	|
| 3. 	| Console                    	| PrinterWriter with PrintPreview set to true 	|
| 4. 	| File with Access Write     	| FileWriter                                  	|
| 5. 	| File with Access Read      	| FileReader                                  	|

| 9. 	| Variable with Access Read  	| ByteArrayReader                             	|
