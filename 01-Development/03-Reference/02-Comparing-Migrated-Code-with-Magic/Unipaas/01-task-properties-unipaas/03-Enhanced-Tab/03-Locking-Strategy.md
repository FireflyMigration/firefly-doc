Note: The migrated code will not write the `RowLocking` property if no locking is required.
The `RowLocking` property will be written whenever a locking is used - even if it was the default in magic. 
It does that to explicitly indicate that there is locking.



### LockCurrentRow
Note: If the Locking Strategy is “On Modify” in Magic (LockingSTrategy.OnUserEdit) then it may be necessary when calling a task or program to specify that the current record with all its links must be locked.  
This may be specified in Magic by clicking Ctrl+P on the call task or call program line, and specifying the lock as 'Yes' in the dialog that appears. To support this functionality, the LockCurrentRow method is employed.  

As an example: 
```csdiff
if(V_counter == 1) 
{ 
    LockCurrentRow(); 
    new ProgramName(this).Run(); 
}  
```
