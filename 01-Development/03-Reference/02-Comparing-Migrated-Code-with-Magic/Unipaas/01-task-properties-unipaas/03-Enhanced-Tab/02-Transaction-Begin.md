Example: 
```csdiff
TransactionScope = TransactionScopes.RowLocking; 
```

Note: The migrated code will not write the `TransactionScope` property if no transaction is required.
The `TransactionScope` property will be written whenever a transaction was set - even if it was the default in magic. 
It does that to explicitly indicate that there is a transaction.
