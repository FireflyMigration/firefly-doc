### Magic internal events
In Magic you can use either the build in internal events or create your own events. This compare table only compares the build in internal events of Magic. In Firefly however these are split into two parts. One part, the internal events are in  Firefly and can be invoked by 'Firefly.Box.Command.' or in short 'Command.. The other part resides in ENV and can be invoked by using 'ENV.Commands.' or in short `Commands.` (with and 's'!).

The newly added handlers in Firefly are also added for search purposes.
