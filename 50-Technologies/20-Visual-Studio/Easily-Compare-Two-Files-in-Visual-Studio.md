When you want to compare two files, you can use visual studio to do that for you.

Simpy open the Visual Studio command window by going to the following menu:
1. View
2. Other Windows
3. Command Window

And in it type the following command:
```
Tools.DiffFiles c:\temp\x.txt c:\temp\y.txt
```

Visual studio will then open it's compare window.

The command window has intelisense and everything so it's actually easy to use.

We hope you'll like it
