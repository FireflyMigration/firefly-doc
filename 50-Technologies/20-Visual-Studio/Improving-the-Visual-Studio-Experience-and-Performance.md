Many times when we do an online sessions with developers I see that their Visual Studio is working slowly and kinda feels as if I stepped on chewing gum.

There are a few simple flag that can be set that can totally change the performance of Visual Studio.

All you need to do is follow the steps in **item B** in the [Configuring Visual Studio
](configuring-visual-studio.html) Article.

## Configure the Anti-virus
Another important tip is to make sure that your anti-virus **trusts the folder** in which your code and build happen. We've seen also in large organizations that the IT Security team can configure a trusted directory in the C# for that - and it's very common for development.
